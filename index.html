        From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_strength">Wikipedia</a>:
        <blockquote>
          Password strength is a measure of the effectiveness of a password
          against guessing or brute-force attacks. In its usual form, it
          estimates how many trials an attacker who does not have direct
          access to the password would need, on average, to guess it correctly.
          The strength of a password is a function of length, complexity,
          and unpredictability.
        </blockquote>
        This website implements that <em>function</em> spoken of.

      as all calculations are done on the client's end with no communication

      is not even a server to communicate with. If you wish to inspect the
