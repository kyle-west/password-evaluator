      <h1>
        Password Strength Checker
      </h1>

      From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_strength">Wikipedia</a>:
      <blockquote>
        Password strength is a measure of the effectiveness of a password 
        against guessing or brute-force attacks. In its usual form, it 
        estimates how many trials an attacker who does not have direct 
        access to the password would need, on average, to guess it correctly. 
        The strength of a password is a function of length, complexity, 
        and unpredictability.
      </blockquote>
      This website implements that <em>function</em> spoken of.

      <p>
        Enter your password below to calculate it's bit strength.
      </p>
      <input type="password" id="password" oninput="calculateStrength(this)"> <input type="button" value="Show/Hide Password" onclick="togglePasswordShow()">
      <p>
        Your password has a bit-strength of <span id="results">0</span>. It would take at most <span id="combinations">0</span> combinations to guess it.

      This website will <em>never</em> store your password information, 
      as all calculations are done on the client's end with no communication

      is not even a server to communicate with. If you wish to inspect the
